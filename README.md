Hello there :)

This is my first game ever, a very interesting n intellectual picture puzzle!

If you have python install in your pc, clone my repo and run "play.py"

If not you can download it here (https://goo.gl/eLARP5) , install and run Travel Egypt in your desktop

Hope you will play my game, and give me some feedback about it (It will highly appreciated!)

Thanks <3
